# Serve OpenAPI (service-catalog) with Docker

This folder contains the OpenAPI spec and a simple Docker setup to serve the static files using nginx.

Files:
- `service-catalog-api.html` — existing HTML view
- `service-catalog-openapi.yaml` — OpenAPI YAML
- `Dockerfile` — builds an nginx image serving the folder
- `docker-compose.yml` — convenience compose file (maps port 8080)

PowerShell: build and run with Docker CLI

```powershell
# from this folder (openapi)
docker build -t interop-openapi:latest .
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 interop-openapi:latest
```

Or use docker-compose (recommended for quick runs):

```powershell
# from this folder (openapi)
docker-compose up --build
```

Then open in your browser:

http://localhost:8080/service-catalog-api.html

Notes:
- The nginx container serves everything in this folder. If the HTML references the YAML with a relative path it will be able to fetch it without CORS issues.
- If you'd like a single-file HTML (no server required), consider `redoc-cli bundle service-catalog-openapi.yaml -o service-catalog-api.html`.
